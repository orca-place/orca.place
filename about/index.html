      <a href="/">Orca.Place</a> was founded in June 2024, though it started as a dream several years earlier. It came
      from a realization, that the water that passes our skins, passes the skins of orcas too. They form gangs with
      loved ones, in search of a life with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to make sure that orcas can see us as allies. Because we believe they are our allies. In orca.place we are
      finding ways to stay on the right path of this natural collaboration.
