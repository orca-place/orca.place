    <p>By: Wizza and In'am Hanim</p>

    <p>
      We are proud to bring you this podcast by Wizza and In'am Hanim. Consisting of two parts – each in Arabic and
      English – Wizza and In'am take listeners on a deep dive into the <i>ongoing</i> political, emotional, and familial
      impacts of the Egyptian revolution of 2011 and the events that followed on the young people who were children and
      teenagers at the time.
