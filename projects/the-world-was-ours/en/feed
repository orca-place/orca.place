    <title>We Felt the World Was Ours</title>
    <description>
      In this podcast by Wizza and In'am Hanim, we explore the impacts that the 2011 revolution
      in Egypt had and continues to have on the children and teenagers of that time. We, Wizza and
      In'am are fictional characters who we were teenagers in the time of the revolution. We
      produced this series for anyone who went through similar revolutionary moments or is in search
      of them. As we interviewed seven other people from our generation for this podcast, and learnt
      about their feelings, it helped us connect with our own feelings regarding the revolution. We
      gained a better understanding of ourselves and the impacts the revolution has on us. We hope
      you find things to connect to as well.

        In the first part we will explore the narrative of the revolution and how young people
        remember it despite the deliberate attempt to erase the history of this time from the
        archive. We will share how our guests perceived the tidal wave of information at the time.
        Their feelings will be our guide.

        In the second part will revisit the climactic moment of the revolution and the confidence
        gained by young people. We will discuss how the revolution enforces the current politics of
        our guests. Their generation is the one shaping the conversations of today. We will close by
        looking ahead to the future.
